### TCL Script

> We need a TCL script that reads a file on the filesystem, the script must process each line using the below rules:
> - lines that present an odd integer value, multiply the value with 3 and print it
> - lines that present an even integer value, multiply the value with 2 and print it
> - lines that present a string value, print the line as is without any changes
> - lines that are float numbers (ex 3.2), print the line as is without any changes
> - Any line that doesn't apply to any previous rule, print "INVALID" message
> - At the end of the script, we need an output of the following:
>   - Sum of all integers (after multiplying them by 3 or 2)
>   - Count of all lines that present a string value



## How To Run
- Configure TCL on your machine —downloading TCL executable and adding it to `PATH`—
- Change directory to project's directory
- Add testing examples to `eval.txt`
- Run the following command `tclsh script.tcl`
